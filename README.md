# Welcome to Cherry On Tech's website

We are a tech squad! We support each other as we learn and grow in our tech careers. We got the idea from [Mo Hampton](https://twitter.com/MoxieHampton)'s [JuneteenthConf](https://www.juneteenthconf.com/) talk, "[Breaking into Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2N5fI5j-IIs)." Learn more about us in an upcoming blog post!

## Tech stack

This website is built using [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/), a static site generator based on [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/). It's under pretty heavy construction, but we love it already, and we hope you do, too!

## Installation

1. Make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/) installed. You can check by running `node --version`
1. Install Gridsome CLI tool if you don't have it: `npm install --global @gridsome/cli` or `yarn global add @gridsome/cli`
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/cherryontech/website.git`
1. `cd website`
1. `npm install` or `yarn install`
1. Run `gridsome develop` to start a local dev server. In the terminal, you will see an address such as `http://localhost:8080/`. Navigate to that address in a browser to see the project in action.

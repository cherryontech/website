title: SPA
definition: SPA stands for Single Page Application. It is a very common way of programming websites these days. The idea is that the website loads all the HTML/JS the first time you visit. When you then navigate, the browser will only rerender the content without refreshing the website.

perspectives:
- meaning: a way for me to make the user experience feel a lot smoother. You can tell when itâ€™s a SPA or multi-page application when navigating between menus often because a multi-page application will reload, making the whole UI blink fast depending on the content
